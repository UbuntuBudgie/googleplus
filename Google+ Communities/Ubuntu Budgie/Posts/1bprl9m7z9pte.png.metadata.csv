We need your help!  As the community grows we will have new members  that need a little bit of help to get where they want to with their shiny new budgie-desktop.

If you've helped out on Ask Ubuntu/Unix & Linux stackexchanges and/or Ubuntu Forums then you already know how to tease out that extra bit of information to help someone to resolve their issue.  Even if you haven't but want to help out this is an easy way to join in.

So, please put your hand-up and become a member of the ""budgie-remix bug busters"" team.  Many thanks.
