"27.06.16 - 1","Hey guys,
since i installed budgie-remix my efi boot screen is just a gray page.
Is this a know issue?
I attached a picture of it, i hope you know what i mean..","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-My-DhVWOAUY/V3FCBpaqKYI/AAAAAAAAJc0/azNCg4osnIUxS99wmZfj5tSCP_XlQyDQACLABGAYYCw/s0-d/27.06.16%2B-%2B1","","720","27 Jun 2016, 15:11:02 UTC","6 Feb 2019, 14:35:13 UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","press and hold the shift button on boot to display grub.  Press e to edit - look for the line that ends &quot;quiet splash $handoff&quot; - remove these and press ctrl+x to boot.  Can you get a photo where it appears to hang?; Doesn&#39;t seem to hang anywhere really..<br />Maybe 2 seconds at &#39;Reached Target Bluetooth&#39; but thats all..<br />Just to clarify what i ment: Normally in place of the gray screen there is the logo of the mainboard manufacturer (asrock in my case).<br />After that the spinning budgie bootscreen appears..; ok - so it boots ok?  Have you just got budgie-remix installed - any other operating systems?  If you just have budgie-remix then I would expect that - its the grub screen colour.; Yes it boots fine. Sorry if i didn&#39;t make that clear..<br />Just budgie-remix but still: Long time ubuntu user here, and i never had this before..","; ; ; ","; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
