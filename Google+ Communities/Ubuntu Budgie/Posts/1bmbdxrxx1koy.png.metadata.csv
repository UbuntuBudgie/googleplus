"Untitled.png","AppIndicator support is currently lacking in budgie-remix/budgie-desktop.Â  We need someone with a little bit of C knowledge to write a wrapper around one of the existing panel indicator implementations.Â  Please put your handup if you can help with this.

Until then - just going to share this with you (look bottom right):

sudo apt install xfce4-panel xfce4-indicator-plugin

Hint - move the budgie panel to the bottom before launching xfce4-panel

Right click xfce4-panel and remove everything - and then add the indicator plugin.Â  Unlock the panel and move it away from the top.Â  Change budgie-panel back to the top.Â  Move the xfce4 panel to the bottom and lock it.Â  Make it transparent, and make it intelli-hide. Voila!

Don't forget to launch xfce4-panel from your startup-applications.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-42WiKlNy_6M/Vvu92TgD9AI/AAAAAAAAF48/HEXjn8mqfZkLzFBjKiVv6Cebm78GWF1lgCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/Untitled.png","","1886","30 Mar 2016, 11:51:53 UTC","6 Feb 2019, 14:23:08 UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","But didn&#39;t GNOME and <i>Unity</i> deprecate app indicators?ï»¿ ðŸ˜•ï»¿; app indicators is still a fundamental part of Unity ... and many packages still have app indicator patches - e.g. skype; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/102148764622145802535"" oid=""102148764622145802535"">david mohammed</a></span>  Well, what about <i>Gnome Shell</i> then? ðŸ˜•; what about it?

But it seems specific to <i>Ubuntu</i> and <i>Unity</i>.ðŸ˜® Do other desktops support it natively? Is it a freedesktop standard or something? ðŸ˜•ï»¿; as far as I know all the ubuntu distros have app indicator support. Â Given that many packages have been patched as well, its more than confusing for people to have apps such as skype not working as they are used to. Â Regardless of whether its a freedesktop standard, for a ubuntu based desktop, budgie-remix needs either native appindicator support or a good workaround.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/102148764622145802535"" oid=""102148764622145802535"">david mohammed</a></span>â€‹  Ah..

Â Probably I would guess that apps have been patched now to expect a proper appindicator rather than converting a QT statusnotifier type app. Â ; sni-qt will cover most apps, but qBittorrent is the app that time and time again will get reported as not working.; have tried a few other &quot;indicator&quot; type apps. Â Nothing is appearing in the system tray. Â Either budgie isnt fully implementing the system-tray xembed stuff correctly or maybe sni-qt is not working on 16.04?; Tried logging out then back in?
