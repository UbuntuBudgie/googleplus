"Workspace 1_002.jpg","Thought I would just update with the latest progress for AppIndicator support for budgie-remix ... looking good!

This is my default working set (left to right)

Variety, Redshift, Qtorrent, VirtualBox Indicator, GIS Weather, ClipIt, Shutter, Radio Tray.

Can confirm My-Weather-Indicator works nicely. NoNotification appindicator doesn't through - this is Unity specific.

AppIndicators works very nicely side-by-side with the system tray. Best for all applications.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2LusAhYOL8A/WBpEO5yNAHI/AAAAAAAAF4Y/qqJzH6TXvy8csJQ90ZnWc-M3kaIyi_RQQCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/Workspace%2B1_002.jpg","","2157","2 Nov 2016, 19:53:31 UTC","6 Feb 2019, 14:23:08 UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0"
