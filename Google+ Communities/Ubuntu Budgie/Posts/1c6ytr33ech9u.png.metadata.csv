"launchpad.png","PSA: a new version of budgie-desktop is now available upstream.  We will be making this available to all budgie-remix users soon.
We would like to get some feedback though and thus need some testers to help out.
Short notice - but in 24hrs I'll be asking our bug-busters team to put the new v10.2.8 desktop through its paces for 16.10 installs.
Once we have sorted out some stuff for 16.04 we will be also asking for some testers.
Feel like you want to help out?  Please join the bug-busters team and subscribe to the mailing list - https://launchpad.net/~budgie-remix-bug-busters","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8LaJz3VjNNg/WAf8B0ZyjHI/AAAAAAAAF44/IYLpVNaClq8K3IBQq-5y1rGRzyTTEMdHgCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/launchpad.png","","1526","19 Oct 2016, 23:04:39 UTC","6 Feb 2019, 14:23:08 UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0"
