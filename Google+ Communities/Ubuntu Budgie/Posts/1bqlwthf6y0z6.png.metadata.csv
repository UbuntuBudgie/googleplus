"PlymouthSmallGrey.png","New Bootsplash! üòÉ

The splash screen seen during bootup is an element that can influence the first impression of new users. Sure, there are users who enable text mode to replace the splash, or use fast booting machines (especially the ones with SSDs) where the splash isn't visible for long, if at all. But, the boot splash always plays an important role in conveying the identity of an OS.

So, we've been working on creating a better splash screen since last month. We chose Ubuntu MATE's Plymouth splash as the starting point. A mockup was made as a reference: https://github.com/budgie-remix/assets/blob/master/Mockups/SplashScreenMockup.svg . Today I'm happy to announce that the concept has become reality!üòÉ The new splash'll be available soon in our Development PPA for testing and later as regular update.Ôªø","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EwxUERjDqWo/VzN_AHkS63I/AAAAAAAABeU/gJBzPbFXnLcnLdiE-QmRptqfMlDneRHwQCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/PlymouthSmallGrey.png","","3482","11 May 2016, 18:50:40 UTC","6 Feb 2019, 07:32:07 UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","hey <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/104644865683307981392"" oid=""104644865683307981392"">HEX cube</a></span> how can i use the development ppa? :) thks; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/118106902969156839938"" oid=""118106902969156839938"">Marcelo Ferreira</a></span> It&#39;s listed on their Launchpad page.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/118106902969156839938"" oid=""118106902969156839938"">Marcelo Ferreira</a></span>‚Äã  Well, the development PPA&#39;s not meant for regular users.
