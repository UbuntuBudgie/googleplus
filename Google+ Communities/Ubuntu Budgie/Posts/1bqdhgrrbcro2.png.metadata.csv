We are looking at the fonts we use in budgie-remix together with our branding.  We currently use Ubuntu fonts in budgie-remix.  Can we do better?  This is where we need your help.  Please submit your mockups on our issues list https://github.com/budgie-remix/budgie-desktop-environment/issues/7

Should we separate out our branding from the fonts used in budgie-remix?  Ideally they should be the same - but not necessarily.

If we change our font in budgie-remix - what font should we use? Screenshots would help here! It needs to work across all the applications - remember keeping the ""elegant and simplicity"" idea of budgie-desktop.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OJj4DaZB0O8/VzB0qb8B_hI/AAAAAAAAF4c/xOtAV0RBx80Ja89EReklZ4VyG9dNCprHACLABGAYYCw/s0-d/a3c25a44-0ccf-11e6-86e9-52a312a0868c.png","","1292","9 May 2016, 11:29:45 UTC","6 Feb 2019, 14:23:08 UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0"
