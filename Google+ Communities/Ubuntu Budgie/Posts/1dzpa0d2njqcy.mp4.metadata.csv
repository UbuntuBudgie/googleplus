Please remember to add the solution to the bug report.  This sort of thing really should be automatically worked out by the intel driver; Unfortunately, that tweak leads to a whole range of other problems, so I don&#39;t recommended. It&#39;s the issue among kernel version, graphics chipset type and budgie environment.; Does turning off window animations (budgie settings) help? (logoff login after changing the option)<br />; I don&#39;t use animation even on the phone. Disabled at first. Thank you for your help man, but I has moved to Ubuntu gnome as I don&#39;t have time to deal with that issue anymore. Thank you one again.","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
