"commands.png","I'm loving this OS, and I'm thinking of moving from Ubuntu (unity) to it. But what I can't live without from unity is the ability to control windows using hot corners and keyboard commands. This is easily done in unity with CCSM.

Is there any way in UB to:

(1) use a hot corner for window spread (I saw a post that skippy-xd may be added, but it is nowhere near as fluid as ccsm's control of window spread)

(2) use keyboard commands to set window snapping (e.g., CTRL+Left Arrow sets the window to the left side of the screen vertically, CTRL+Shift+Left Arrow sets the window to the upper 1/2 horizontally of the left side of the screen vertically).

(3) set keyboard combinations to run commands (like the CCSM ""Commands"" feature, see below).

Thanks -- hoping I can make the move to UB permanently.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JmrNZnfv28A/WC5l102mbuI/AAAAAAAAADQ/fMHChn1d-m4Ls-BIQfJA4j0EpR_wYwxQwCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/commands.png","","1414","18 Nov 2016, 02:22:15 UTC","7 Feb 2019, 08:32:06 UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","Hi and welcome!<br />  just a few notes - skippy-xd has hotcorner support built in.  You can also use &quot;brightside&quot; to add your own custom hotcorner actions as well.<br /><br />for windows snapping left/right settings - keyboard -shortcuts super-left/right do that job ... this is defined in settings - keyboard -windows - you can change the keyboard shortcut there to CTRL+LEFT/RIGHT<br /><br />For your own keyboard combinations - same keyboard shortcuts window - you can define your own shortcut and commands to run.<br /><br />For the quarter tiling -  the window manager doesnt have this natively built in.  I know there are gnome-shell extensions such as gtile that do this sort of thing - so it would be awesome if someone could convert something like that lets say in Python to be runnable and then we can hook that up to SHIFT+CTRL_LEFT/RIGHT.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/102148764622145802535"" oid=""102148764622145802535"">david mohammed</a></span> Re. skippy having built-in hotcorner support.

I was able to get Brightside and XDSkippy working together, though the window spread action using these two tools is pretty clumsy compared to Compiz. <br /><br />I&#39;d love to see the quarter tile function too.","; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
