They are so close on the back end side of things, and I don&#39;t think Budgie is particularly light on resources. The whole point of Budgie, was to make a DE that&#39;s simple and palatable to migrators etc, but with a more modern look than say Mate or Cinnamon. Definitely my favourite Ubuntu Flavour/Derivative right now. As pictured, if people want an OSX knock off, there&#39;s Elementary....; Simple menu from KDE is nice too. It would fit in very well.
