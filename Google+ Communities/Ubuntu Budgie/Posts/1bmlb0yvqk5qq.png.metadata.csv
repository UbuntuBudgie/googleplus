"Screenshot from 2016-04-01 23-00-38.png","I've been trying this distribution all day and i like it so far, but here are some bugs and comments. First there should be an option to change the xdashborad shortcut, i use a lot the combination of ctrl+tab to navigate between tabs on firefox and now i cant do that, i disable the xdashboard shorcut on keyboard settings, because i was unable to change and here come the second bug that i found, it been many times when trying to change the settings of something and the button just seems not to be working or something, like wifi configuration. Also i put here a screenshot of what happend if you use the regular task list and you have a lot of windows open. I know is a beta so that why im putting this comment. Keep the good work.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uEhIha3LNAw/Vv9SD6ahsBI/AAAAAAAABtE/_F_4gY8n3bsjRG2YVB5jUlI2WgluRj3iwCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2016-04-01%2B23-00-38.png","","1207","2 Apr 2016, 05:01:03 UTC","7 Feb 2019, 09:23:10 UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","Use the keyboard applet in gnome control settings ... Choose shortcuts and you can change the combination.  I&#39;m aware of the regular task issue.  There is an upstream bug report for this.  File a bug report on our tracker and I&#39;ll let you know when upstream fixes this.
