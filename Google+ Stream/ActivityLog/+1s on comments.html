I don&#39;t actually like Qt applications. I want to keep the GNOME ones. As +HEX cube says they&#39;re great. I&#39;m interested only in changing the technology that powers the shell part of Budgie, i.e. the panel and such.  Whilst GNOME apps are great, GNOME has a singular vision for their desktop. Unfortunately it makes it increasingly difficult to balance the desires for Budgie against a moving and increasingly tight/closed base.  Also keep in mind Budgie doesn&#39;t actually have any &quot;apps&quot; as such. So no need to make any more.  Obviously if Ubuntu Budgie had concerns with the approach, I&#39;d listen to them. They are the only other big advocate for Budgie, and a big downstream. I&#39;ve no interest in jeopardising that, or causing issues for Budgie users.  Lastly, though, the Ubuntu Budgie team, like any other team, would do what they feel best meets the needs of  their users. — Loving your work guys.  Question..

Budgie has been in a bit of a disorganised lull for too long, so as much as 11 is about righting the wrongs in development, its also righting Budgie as a project. Budgie 11 should, in all ways, be more inclusive, and extended to the whole Budgie family. Budgie Remix is a huge part of that family, and indeed one of only 2 distros that push for Budgie to be better in a very public and dedicated way, by virtue of making it our primary desktop.  It took even me a while to see some of the issues, and the fact is one of my primary complaints about other desktops in the past were very much tied to their parent project. I&#39;m not comfortable being a hypocrite, which is why you see such a drive right now to enforce the independence of Budgie :)  I look forward to working with you all in attaining that goal of making Budgie the #1 goto desktop, and honestly, us all enjoying it on an equal peer footing, is the most important part to me :) — The Eleventh Budgie  As Budgie goes forward on the path to 11.0.0 - I&#39;d like the Budgie Remix people to be a part of that.  https://github.com/budgie-desktop/budgie-desktop/projects/1  We&#39;ve seen all too often lately that a communication issue puts either the Budgie crew or the Remix crew into an odd light. I also dislike (as I&#39;m sure others do) that there has to be any distancing at all, yet up until now it has been necessary.  So, let&#39;s try to fix this. There are elements of Budgie Remix that are indeed very OS-specific. An example of this is the Budgie Welcome screen, it&#39;s tailor-made for Budgie Remix, and should obviously remain that way.  An example of something that should likely be upstreamed, is some applets. One I would have liked to have seen some effort on upstreaming was the AppIndicator applet. It would appear that so far it is tied exclusively to Budgie Remix.  So, here&#39;s what I&#39;m proposing. As you all know, with Budgie 11, we&#39;ve already moved Budgie Desktop out from underneath the Solus GitHub umbrella, into it&#39;s very own GitHub organisation. We also want to see more things happening in their own repos so that we&#39;re able to move away from our monolithic architecture.  As part of &quot;The Eleventh Budgie&quot; workboard, issue 713 should be of particular interest: https://github.com/budgie-desktop/budgie-desktop/issues/713.  All components within the Budgie Desktop GitHub organisation will lose their Solus branding, replaced with the wording:  &quot;&lt;component_name&gt; is a component of the Budgie Desktop&quot;, accompanied by the free Budgie Desktop logo. Previously this stated &quot;is a Solus project&quot;, including the all-rights-reserved Solus project branding.  This is us throwing the doors completely open here, as we drive home the absolute necessity for Budgie to be completely agnostic, and not tied to any one distro (i.e. Solus, or Remix, or anything).  With that in mind, I would like to see that philosophy extended to downstreams, and I would like you to consider moving some of the currently Ubuntu specific components (such as the AppIndicator) into the new organisation, to facilitate first-class development in an agnostic fashion.  I would far rather see Budgie Remix work together with the Budgie crew, than in silos. There is more than just Ubuntu and Solus in the world :)  If you are interested, then let&#39;s start a discussion on the roadmap, and let me know what resources you need to accomplish this. I would like to see standardisation across all the repos. There is a &quot;gotcha&quot;, of course. No official Budgie Desktop git repo should contain any packaging files of any kind. After all, distro agnostic, so no `debian` branches :)  It should be noted I&#39;m not just going for &quot;distro-agnostic&quot; here. Once the initial move to 11 is completed, Budgie itself will be portable enough, for once, to run on any *nix with the appropriate stack.<div class="footer"><span class="time" title="2016-11-08T16:00+0000">Nov 8, 2016, 4:00:14 PM</span><br>Public</div></div></div></div><div class="log"><div class="item"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA9LWjTfh_hrXVDR_x0fk639PlSlQZ3OzCC3OPS1w=w100-h100-n" target="_blank" class="media-link"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA9LWjTfh_hrXVDR_x0fk639PlSlQZ3OzCC3OPS1w=w100-h100-n" alt="Image" class="media"></a><div class="text"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+IkeyDoherty/posts/1EfYcV3hptJ" class="item-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">+1'd comment on post by Ikey Doherty in Ubuntu Budgie</a>Ikey - on behalf of the team - and by extension all budgie-remix users - we thank-you for your thoughts presented here.  We concur on the drive towards a collegiate way of working.  This can only fulfil the ultimate desire for all of us - to make budgie-desktop the #1 go-to DE.  The team were a little surprised with your thoughts on the appindicator applet.  As you know, only debian, ubuntu (and I think somewhere on Arch) have libappindicator-3 in their repos.  However - happy to contribute this - especially if libappindicator-3 is available on more platforms than we think; this will bring benefit to all of us users and allows a very rich ecosystem to become quickly available - and hopefully spurring more native solutions to become available.  We recognise that working together will definitely benefit all - working to reduce confusion - and ultimately bring new users on-board. — The Eleventh Budgie  As Budgie goes forward on the path to 11.0.0 - I&#39;d like the Budgie Remix people to be a part of that.  https://github.com/budgie-desktop/budgie-desktop/projects/1  We&#39;ve seen all too often lately that a communication issue puts either the Budgie crew or the Remix crew into an odd light.
