"16.10alpha.jpg","16.10 ALPHA ISOs are now available for testing.

We urge all testers to subscribe to our bug-busters mailing list - alpha issues via G+ will be IGNORED.

On the mailing list please let everyone know your thoughts - good thoughts are most welcome as well ;)

We DO NOT recommend these to be used on production systems.

If you have any spare hardware then please test the installation - we ask when the Beta and Final releases are made you do a fresh install - not a continuous upgrade.

Please read the README available on our sourceforge download location:

Use our GITTER community page to discuss any issues one on one with the team.
