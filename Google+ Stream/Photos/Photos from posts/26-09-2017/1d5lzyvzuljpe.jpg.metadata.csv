"you-know-you-want-to-test-ubuntu-budgie-now.jpg","Hi All,

our final 17.10 beta is out and it needs urgent testing.

Our testing page that you should really bookmark is:
https://ubuntubudgie.org/testing

Please use your launchpad account and login to the ISO tracker - this
is where you can download the ISO and also find the test cases and
feedback results (if the test case passes - please submit a pass
result!!)

I can't emphasize that enough! If you miss the marking of either pass
or fail on a test case, no one knows the excellent testing job you are
doing :)

Some links for you:

How to use the ISO tracker:
https://www.tsimonq2.net/blog/2016/04/27/

Beta 2 is here - http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/382/builds

Download links for the 32bit and 64bit ISOs are there.

Release notes: https://ubuntubudgie.org/blog/2017/09/25/17-10-release-notes

Suggestion - use spare hardware if you have - or virtual tools like
virtualbox/vmware/qemu/gnome boxes etc

turnaround time is very tight - we need to finish the testing by
Thursday early morning (GMT)

thanks
