"125ab9c.jpg","we need a graphics designer/artist
The Ubuntu Budgie team are on the look out for a new member of the team as a graphics designer/artist.  Udara has been doing a wonderful job in this role but has had to step away for the moment :(

The person needs to be be enthusiastic who loves to integrate and create innovative artwork at fairly short  notice to fit and target single or multiple platforms - websites/newsletters/application artwork etc.

Interested?  Go-on - its a great open-source opportunity!  Contact us through our websites https://ubuntubudgie.org/contact and https://budgie-remix.org/support-us/ or come and have a chat in our community chat room - https://gitter.im/ubuntubudgie/community","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0X6kpK0vt_Q/WFKcosMPG9I/AAAAAAAABHE/T4gq18aUVcA2L6eJF67iY-evkC6dGRm7ACLABGAYYCw/s0-d/125ab9c.jpg","","1786","Dec 15, 2016, 1:37:38 PM UTC","Feb 6, 2019, 3:04:03 PM UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0"
