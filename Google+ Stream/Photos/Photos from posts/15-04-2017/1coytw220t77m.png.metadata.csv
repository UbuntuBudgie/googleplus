"Wallpapoz_757.png","Per Workspace Wallpaper

As you I'm sure have found out, you can only have one wallpaper for all workspaces. As far as I can gather GNOME doesn't support per workspace wallpapers. Kind of a shame really. ðŸ˜ž

So here is a neat app which I have adapted for Budgie desktop. Let me know if it's useful. I might make it a debian package to be easily installable. Equally - if you know of a better way let me know! ðŸ˜Š

Until then:

git clone https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/wallpapoz
cd wallpapoz/src
./wallpapoz

Change your wallpaper for each workspace (right click for the menu you see here).
Click Save
Click Restart for the Daemon

If you want this on startup - just add the launcher in that folder to your start up applications.
