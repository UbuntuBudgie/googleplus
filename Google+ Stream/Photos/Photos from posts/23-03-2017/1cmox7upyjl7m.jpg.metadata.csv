At the moment it looks like a very small minority of users are impacted.  Dropping the animations for the popovers affects everyone and seems like a retrograde step for the majority of users who are not affected.  We need a real fix.  If there is an indication that there is much more than we think then yes we&#39;ll drop the animations.  Otherwise we might just handle via a PPA until upstream examine the issue further.; ok... but ya using the ppa disabling the animation doesnt feel so good btw.... <br />; and if its affecting a small no. of users, does that have anything to do with cpu,gpu specs?<br />","; ; ; ","; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
